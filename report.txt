The project in intended to be used for safe medicine and goods delivery to the patients, collect patients vitals and for assisting patients.This project will be useful in pandemic situation as it bridges health care personnel and patients in a safe and hygiene way.Introduction:The concept of robot is really old. One of the first instances of building a machine to carry out repetitive tasks happened at around 3000 B.C. Although the definition of Robots has changed quite a bit throughout the years. Any Electro-Mechanical machine which is capable of carrying out some task or series of tasks automatically is called a robot. Also, some manual remotely operated machines can also be classified as a robot. A robot reasons upon its environment based on the implemented on-board logic and programming. Robots have become a part and parcel in our daily industrial works. Robots have been working alongside humans. Combination of people, institutions and resources whose purpose is to provide health care services are collectively knows as Health Care system. Lately there have been a boom in research in the healthcare robots. [1] The main task of a healthcare robot is to provide services to the human users which will improve their health and lifestyle. Health care robot can range from simple cleaning robots or delivery robots to more complex surgery robots. [4] Currently there are several scopes where a health care robot can be deployed. [2] Cleaning and disinfecting robots, these types of robots are primarily used for cleaning and disinfecting environment from dangerous pathogens.[3] Nurse Robots, whose main functions are carrying patients or assisting patients by telecommunication.[5] Surgery Robots, whose main purpose is to remotely operate surgery upon patients, some robots are capable of performing fully unmanned surgery. [6] Tele-medicine robots are used virtually present health care provider to the patient.[7] Rehabilitation robot helps patients to return back to their normal life after certain illness or addiction.[8] delivery robots, as their name suggests delivers foods, medicine and other goods to the patients.In this work, we have proposed an cost efficient autonomous assistive robot which will be used in the medical sector and which is able to play a vital role in pandemic times. Our project is a line based maze solver robot which can map hospital beds and rooms by solving maze form the hospital floor. The robot uses PID control loop in order to follow the line and uses Left hand Algorithm for maze solving. The robot uses 10 Infrared Line detector sensors in order to sense the Black line on white surface. The robot uses on-board sensors to collect environment data as well as patient vital collection data. The robot can also be controlled manually. And as the robot is also equipped with a 5-DOF robotic arm, it has a great potential to be used as a Tele-medicine Robot. The robot also uses a medicine delivery system in order to autonomously delivery medicines to the patients.Our project also consists of a 5-DOF robotics arm, which is controlled by an onboard microcontroller. We have used Arduino Uno as the microcontroller. The arm has wireless bionic control mechanism which allows the user to control the robot using hand gestures with a wearable remote, which is intuitive to use. Mechanically, a robotic arm can be defined based on the nature of the relative movement between its links. There are five different types of Robot Arm configurations. [9]They are as follows:•Cartesian (3P)• Cylindrical (R2P)• Spherical (Polar) (2 RP)• Articulated (3R)• SCARA (2R in horizontal + 1P in vertical plane)Where R is Revolute Joint and P is Prismatic Joint. Our Developed Robot only consists of Revolute joint. A revolute joint is a 1-DOF joint along the common axis, which is also known as hinge joint. [10]Our robotic arm contains five revolute joints. We have used High torque metal geared Servos as Actuators. The fabrication of the entire robot body is done with plywood.Motivation:A pandemic is defined as a wide outbreak of infectious disease occurring within the world or within a vast area. As a lot of people get affected simultaneously during a pandemic within a short time interval, it becomes almost uncontrollable. But with proper risk assessment, and precautions the effects of a pandemic situation can be neutralized. [11] During the recent COVID-19 pandemic situation several research suggested that the front-line health care workers were at more risk of getting infected than anyone else. That is because healthcare workers are always exposed to patients with contagious disease. Also in a pandemic situation scarcity of health care protective equipment's are observed. So, healthcare workers are not only in a risk of getting affected, but also a potential carrier of pathogens if proper precautions aren't taken. In situations like these robotics can play a vital role, in making the healthcare system more safe, efficient and hygienic. Apart from the pandemic situations, uses of Tele-medicine robots and nurse robots can ensure 24 hrs of patient monitoring. [12] Hundreds of patients are dying because of the lack of nursing care and proper monitoring at the hospitals.[13] Plus in some cases nurses are not compassionate enough while treating patients. [14] Treating patients with rude behavior are not uncommon in hospitals. These things can lead a patient to further risk as mental health plays an important role in the well being of the patient. Also, critically diseased patients need ceaseless care, which is sometimes not possible to provide by human beings. So, this project is intended to leave an impact in the health care industry by saving lives and may play an important role in fighting pandemic situations.Literature Review:In research conducted by Swati and Pankaj, several maze solving algorithms were discussed and compared for their efficiency. The maze used in their research was a wall based maze which had an opening and an ending. Left hand follower algorithm, Right hand Follower algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm and flood fill algorithm were used. Among them Flood-fill algorithm was the most efficient in finding the optimal path.The utilization and necessity of robots in healthcare has been discussed in the research conducted by Zeashan, Afifa and Chang.According to the research, healthcare robots should have the following characteristics, 1. Proper Sterilization, 2. Operator Safety, 3. Ease of Handling and Maintenance, 4. Power Requirement, 5. Cost effectiveness.Health-care robots may have the following Classification:Receptionist robot,Nurse Robot,Ambulance Robot,Tele-Medicine Robot,Hospital serving robot,Rehabilitation robot,Food Robot, Outdoor Delivery robot.Robotic nurses are likely to be more common than actual nurses in future Japanese Healthcare. Dinosow, Relay, TUG, RP-VITA, Roomba i7, Moxi, Ambulot are some of the robots which are being used in the medical field already. So, robots if utilized properly can play a crucial role in fighting pandemics of contagious disease.Line follower robots can also be utilized in the medical field. P. Shubha and M. Meenakshi [p2019.pdf]has published a work which focuses on solving tasks which are meant to be done by nurses using a Line Follower Robot. Their project uses clock module to autonomously deliver prescribed medicines to the patients. The robot uses radio frequency for communication and traverses following a line guidance. In another work published by a team from Qassim University, a health care system which consists of a mobile application to manipulate the patient medicines is featured. The project also features Telecommunication between doctor and patient, environment data collection and alarm for prescribed medicine.[alharbi2019]Deepak, Neeraj, Vartika published a work which mainly focuses on using a line solver robot to make it recognize hospital beds. The robot relies on intersection on the line to identify the hospital beds. The robot counts the intersection number to keep track of the bed number. [IJARCET_VOL_2_ISSUE]Lately there have been quite a few research in making robotic arms more user friendly and easy to use. A accelerometer gesture based robotic arm is featured by Love, Varnika, Puneet's work. An accelerometer based gesture recognition system is used in their published work. The robot basically tries to match the preset movements in the memory with the current gesture by the user.[Design_and_Implementation_of_a_Wireless_Gesture_Co] Another work by  Pankaj and  Milind features a robotic arm which can be controlled using real time hand tracking from the camera. The system determines the angle of the users arm and sends the data to the controlling micro-controller which then moves the mechanical arm accordingly. Rationale of Study:The hunt for the perfect robot which will revolutionize the health sector for both the health care workers and patients, has been going on for years. And because of that we have seen an exponential growth in research of health care robots. One of the advantages of using line guidance based robots over the camera sensor based robots is that, line guidance based robots are more efficient to be used in the open areas like hospital wards. So, many teams have already worked on Line Guidance based robots in Health Care sector. But, our work fixes previous problems in this sector. Our robot uses efficient PID based algorithm for line tracing. It has a robotic arm which can be used to guide patients during a Tele-medicine session, which a lot of previous work didn't had. We have used a variation of Left Hand Maze solving algorithm which enables the robot to traverse from one hospital bed to another. Our work also consists of a medicine delivery system which delivers correct medicine to the patient at the right time with great accuracy. Also, we have focused on making an efficient machine with affordable parts. Our robot relies on Line Following rather than LIDAR or camera based localization. So, inherently our robot is cost efficient than other robots of this caliber which makes this project really vital in developing countries. So, work is vital as it solves previous issues among similar works.Expected Output:Our work is to make a robot which will have both autonomous and manual functionalities, and will be used by health care professionals in order to make the health care sector more efficient and hygienic. We can quantify the outcomes of our project in the following manner:
	* The robot should have Tele-Medicine capabilities, which will allow a health care personnel to treat patients from a distance in case of contagious disease.
	* The robot should contain a manual mechanical arm, which will be helpful in assisting patients in Tele-Medicine mode.
	* The robot should be able to follow a line.
	* The robot should solve maze patterns in order to get the hospital bed location.
	* The robot system will contain an IOT website, which will be used for patient data management.
	* The robot will have obstacle avoidance capabilities.
	* The robot will be able to keep track of time and deliver medicines to the correct patients.
	* The robot will be able to obtain patient vitals using on board sensors, and store it in the online database.
	* The robot will be able to deliver goods to the patients.

Scope of the Problem:Our research focuses on creating a Robot which will have both autonomous and manual functionalities, and which will be used in the healthcare sector, mainly during the pandemic times or to deal with patients having contagious disease. We have proposed a robotic system which relies on line following in order to travel. So, our main research will focus on a maze solving technique. Our robot also consists of a robotic arm, and a collision avoidance system. Also our robot relies on an Internet of Things website for patient data management.We wont be discussing inverse kinematics as our mechanical arm does not relies on Inverse kinematic model. Also we have used a version of Left Hand Maze solving algorithm, so we will mainly focus on that algorithm alone.Challenges:Comparative Analysis and Summary:The idea of involving line follower based robots in various fields are not new. But the fact is, there is a lot of room for improvement in this sector of Line follower robots. And for this very reason, Line following robots are still fairly popular among researchers. [15] Alvarez et al. (2018) have worked on a similar project, where they have created a robotics system which can be a substitute for a real human nurse, and whose objective will be to monitor elderly patients or sick people and keep the physician up to date with patient vitals. In their work they have proposed a system which can recognize voice, take decisions based on data from camera image in real time, and it has different sensors for patient monitoring. Even though the goal of our project is similar to of this project, but our robot relies on line following for locomotion, which is an advantage as we want to deploy our robot in hospitals. Our project features advanced features like autonomous medicine delivery, IOT controls and a robotic arm. But on the contrary our robot lacks voice command based controls. Punetha, Kumar and Mehta (2013) described in their paper about the use of a Line Follower Robot in Healthcare sector. In their research they created a Line follower robot which mainly delivers medicine and other goods to the bed ridden patients. Their system uses hard coded values to detect the beds from the line and relies on a Infrared based remote control for the user instruction. Their robot uses Visible Light sensitive LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to detect the Line. Now, in contrast to our system, we have used Infrared LED and Infrared Sensitive Receiver in order to detect the Line. This is more efficient as our sensor system does not malfunction in the case of sudden ambient light change in the room. Also, we have created a more dynamic bed recognition system, which lets the admin user to label the any bed with any unique number in the robot system. Our system relies on an IOT(Internet Of Things) based website for user data input. Punetha et al. (2013) further described that their robot relies on a IR based obstacle detector to avoid collision. Where as our system scans the entire area in front of it to look for possible obstacle, by creating a 2D map as a result it has better collision avoidance system.[16] In a another work, a group of researchers have developed a hospital delivery robot, which delivers various items internally in the hospital. The Robot uses SLAM(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) based navigation and localization. In this method the robot system uses a combination of LIDARs (Light Detection and Ranging) to map the environment around it. And then with the help of odometry, the robot localizes itself with respect to the environment. In this work, they have proposed a system which relies on 2 seperate LIDAR sensors for localization. Now, the main advantage of using a SLAM based system over a Line Follower robot is that, the SLAM based robot doesn't need any permanent Line inside the environment for locomotion. But on the downside, SLAM based systems are less reliable in open spaces. And SLAM based robots like this one mentioned here are incredibly expensive to implement, as they require complex sensors to be efficient. Which can be a problem if we want to deploy robots in developing countries. So, compared to this system, our proposed system is much cheaper. And in open hospital Wards and Lobbies, our Line Follower based system can perform much better, as unlike SLAM algorithm. SLAM based robots have to be in direct contact with environment surrounding it to identify their relative location. Line Followers does not rely on this principle. Our main robot consists a robotic, which is manual and intended to be used to treat patients from a distance during pandemic times, or in case of contagious disease. Aggarwal, Gaur and Verma (2013) have published a work, where they have proposed a system, which enables a robotic arm to be used as an extension of Human arm. The robot arm imitates the movement of it's Human User. They have used gesture based control for their work. They have used a combination of inertial sensors, which is placed on user hand and user leg. The system tries to recognize previously saved patterns from the gestures of the users hand and leg. The robot then carries out those movements. This system has several issues, as they can only carry out certain set number of movements. Compared to our system, our robotic arm uses a pair of Inertial Measurement Unit with combination of a potentiometer to capture the position of the users hand. The mechanical arm imitates the motion of the users hand in real time with a refresh rate of thirty times per second. Our system uses 2.4 GHz radio to transmit the user commands to the main robotic arm. This robotic arm gives our robot great telemedicine capabilities.   Research Questions: The study is intended to answer the following questions:
	1. Why is it feasible to use Line follower robots in Health care?
	2. How can a Maze solver algorithm be modified to be used to detect hospital patients?
	3. Why is it necessary to deploy robots in health care sector?
